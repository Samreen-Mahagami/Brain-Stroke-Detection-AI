# Brain Stroke Detection AI

AWS-powered agentic AI system for automated brain stroke detection using medical imaging, computer vision, and generative AI.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
DICOM Upload → AWS HealthImaging → SageMaker (CV Model) → Bedrock (Report Generation) → Clinical Report
```

## 🎯 Features

- **Automated DICOM Ingestion**: Secure upload and storage via AWS HealthImaging
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Computer vision models for stroke detection
- **Generative AI Reports**: Clinical reports generated by Amazon Bedrock
- **Serverless Architecture**: Scalable, cost-effective AWS infrastructure
- **HIPAA-Compliant**: Medical-grade security and compliance

## 🚀 Project Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: DICOM Ingestion & Storage (COMPLETED)
- AWS HealthImaging datastore
- S3 bucket for uploads
- DynamoDB for metadata tracking
- Lambda functions for processing
- API Gateway endpoint
- Step Functions workflow

**Status**: Deployed and tested successfully

### 🔄 Phase 2: Image Preprocessing & Retrieval (In Progress)
- Retrieve DICOM frames from HealthImaging
- Image preprocessing (normalization, windowing)
- Prepare data for ML inference

### 📋 Phase 3: SageMaker Model Deployment (Planned)
- Deploy stroke detection CV model
- Real-time inference endpoint
- Quantitative analysis (volume, location, severity)

### 🤖 Phase 4: Bedrock Report Generation (Planned)
- Generate clinical reports with Amazon Bedrock
- Evidence-based recommendations
- Structured medical documentation

### 🔔 Phase 5: Alerting & Integration (Planned)
- SNS notifications for critical findings
- EHR system integration
- Dashboard and monitoring

## 📋 Prerequisites

- AWS Account with HealthImaging enabled
- AWS CLI configured
- Python 3.11+
- IAM permissions for CloudFormation, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, HealthImaging

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Deploy Phase 1

```bash
cd phase1_ingestion
./deploy.sh
```

### 2. Upload DICOM File

```bash
# Upload to S3
aws s3 cp your_scan.dcm s3://stroke-detection-ai-dicom-uploads-{ACCOUNT_ID}/studies/STUDY-001/

# Trigger processing
curl -X POST https://{API_ID}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/upload \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "patient_id": "P123456",
    "file_key": "studies/STUDY-001/your_scan.dcm",
    "study_description": "Brain CT - Stroke Protocol"
  }'
```

### 3. Check Status

```bash
# Query DynamoDB
aws dynamodb scan --table-name stroke-detection-ai-study-metadata

# Check Step Functions
aws stepfunctions list-executions \
  --state-machine-arn arn:aws:states:us-east-1:{ACCOUNT}:stateMachine:stroke-detection-ai-processing
```

## 📊 Current Status

**Phase 1 Deployment**: ✅ Successfully deployed and tested
- API Endpoint: Active
- HealthImaging: Operational
- Sample DICOM: Processed successfully
- Status: READY_FOR_ANALYSIS

## 🔐 Security

- All data encrypted at rest (S3, DynamoDB, HealthImaging)
- IAM roles with least privilege access
- HIPAA-eligible AWS services
- CloudTrail audit logging
- VPC deployment option available

## 💰 Cost Estimation

**Per 1000 studies:**
- S3 Storage: ~$0.50
- HealthImaging: ~$10
- DynamoDB: ~$0.25
- Lambda: ~$0.20
- Step Functions: ~$0.25
- API Gateway: ~$0.10
- **Total**: ~$11.30/1000 studies
